# hayum-service
*[hayum.in](http://alpha-v2.hayum.in)*
  
Backend for hayum. It was written using `Nodejs` but I have decided to use `Golang` instead.
It is much more fun to implement in `Golang` with the advantages of a compiled, static typed language and low memory footprint.

**Note: This is just a mirror. Actual development happens on a bitbucket private repo.
